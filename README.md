ToDoList App

A simple and intuitive To-Do List application to help you organize tasks, prioritize them, and keep track of your daily productivity. This project is designed to allow users to add, delete, and mark tasks as complete, with a color-coded priority system to improve task management.
Features

    Add new tasks with a title and description.
    Assign priority levels to tasks (High, Medium, Low).
    Mark tasks as complete or incomplete.
    Color-coded priority system:
        High Priority: Red
        Medium Priority: Orange
        Low Priority: Green
        No Priority: Light Blue
    Delete tasks when they are no longer needed.
    Responsive and clean user interface.

Technologies Used

    HTML/CSS: Structure and styling of the app.
    JavaScript: Handles the logic for adding, deleting, and managing tasks.
    LocalStorage: Stores tasks locally so that they persist even after refreshing the page.

Installation

    Clone the repository:

    bash

    git clone https://github.com/Merryndo/ToDoList.git
